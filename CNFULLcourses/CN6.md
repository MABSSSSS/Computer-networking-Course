**REPEATER:**

through which we can boostup the weak signals.

When signal travels in network , after travelling some distance the internsity of signal becomes low.

Inorder to regerate the weak signal we shouls use repaeter device.


Note: 

is used in wired and wireless.

Advantage:
used to regenrate the weak signal.
cheaper than other network device.
Repeater has ability to extedn teh length of signal.
increase/mantain the signal performance.

Disadavatage:

Required no of repater after some distances.
Repeaters also unable to connect dissimilar type of network .
They cant reduce network traffic.
